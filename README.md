Depending on the complexity of your application and the time available in your presentation, a brief walkthrough of your codebase would also be nice but not mandatory

explain the technical aspects of their work in a clear and concise way to someone like a developer wanting to get an overview of your application in order for them to continue developing it. 

So aim to present within 10 minutes, as the MSA team will be able to assess the details of your work through the link to the deployed application and your code repository/ies.
